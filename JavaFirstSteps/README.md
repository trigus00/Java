# Java
Java First Steps: 

- Printing hello world
- Use of Variable and Data types 
- Byte, short, int, Long and overflow and underflow 
- Casting 
- Challenge:
    - Your challenge is to create a byte variable and set it to any valid byte number.
      Create a short variable and set it to any valid short number.
      create an int variable and set it to any valid int number. Lastly, create a variable of type long.
      Make the long variable equal to 50000 plus 10 times the sum of the byte plus the short plus the integer values.
      print the results 
- Floats and Doubles
    - evaluating the precision of the use of Floats and doubles. Double is better due to faster processing (at the chip level) and math function had the double in the arithmetic.
- Challenge2:
    1) Create a variable with the appropriate type to store the number of pounds to be converted to kilograms
    2) Calculate the result i.e the number of kilograms based on the contents of the variable above and store the result in a 2nd appropriate variable 
    3) Print the results
